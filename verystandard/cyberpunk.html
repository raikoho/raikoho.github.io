        <p class="cyber-text">In the neon-lit alleys of the digital realm, technology pulses like the heartbeat of a sleeping giant. As networks entwine, as systems merge, we stand on the edge of a new dawn—one forged in the crucible of code and shadows. Here, cyber attackers navigate the currents of data with a predator's stealth, moving unseen through the vast architecture of modern civilization.</p>

        <p class="cyber-text">The age of information? It is merely the beginning. Beneath the surface lies a darker world where <span class="neon">code</span> is a weapon, <span class="neon">firewalls</span> are but glass walls, and <span class="neon">vulnerabilities</span> are doorways to unlimited power.</p>

        <p class="cyber-text">Attack vectors evolve. New exploits emerge. And somewhere, someone is always watching. The cyber world is a battleground—a domain where victory belongs to those who understand its chaos.</p>

        <p class="cyber-text">From ransomware to zero-day exploits, from social engineering to DDoS attacks, the arsenal grows. In this high-stakes game, you’re either the hunter, or the hunted. Embrace the neon. Hack the future.</p>
