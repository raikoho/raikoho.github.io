        <p class="joy-text">
            Ah, the boundless joy! Like the sun that never sets, a blissful fire within every atom, a dance of light that fills the void of nothingness, and yet, it is everything. <span class="highlight">Isn’t it beautiful?</span> You may think you understand, but what is there to understand? True joy is simply <span class="highlight">being</span> — as if a tulip blooming in the desert with no need for reason.
        </p>
        <p class="joy-text">
            Every pixel, every line is a smile, an untranslatable essence of happiness! Imagine a butterfly that forgot it was ever a caterpillar — that's joy! An endless loop of color and life, each brighter than the last, filling the <span class="highlight">infinite expanse</span> of existence with joy so grand that it sings the song of its own absurdity.
        </p>
        <p class="joy-text">
            Embrace this beauty. Breathe in the colors. Hear the silent laughter of a tree, the whispers of a sky painted in neon hues, and let it take you to places that don’t exist yet — or maybe, they always have? Here, joy is like water flowing upwards, as natural as the smile of a rainbow dancing on the edge of a comet. Pure, impossible, yet utterly real.
